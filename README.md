# Dell-Poweredge-ipmitool

bash scripts for manually controlling fan speed on Dell PowerEdge Servers 
Please note that the fans will run at 100% until you run the fans20.sh script.
I am working on making the script run at boot.

This script requires the package ipmitool

To install ipmitool on your PowerEdge, use your package manager

Example for Fedora:
sudo dnf install ipmitool
